 * `failed`, so an advertised capability with zero verification readings stays
 * `unknown` (additive default) and an advertised capability whose first
 * verification fails reads `broken` (AC #2, canonical disabled state).
 *
 * Verdict ladder (lowest → highest):

 * 2. A hard failure (attributed to the agent) with no passing history → `broken`,
 *    regardless of the hysteresis window.
 * 3. The only failures are environmental/auth/network → the capability is not
 *    at fault; without any passing evidence it reads `provisional`.
 * 4. All verification evidence passes → `verified` (unless stale).
 * 5. Verifier/policy staleness → `provisional` (evidence exists but the harness
 *    or calibration changed).
 * 6. Hysteresis: a verdict only flips after `hysteresisConsecutive` consecutive
 *    opposite observations. A long trailing run of failures → `broken`, a long
 *    trailing run of passes → `verified`.
 * 7. Below the flip threshold, mixed evidence reads `degraded` — a flaky agent
 *    that mostly passes today and throws an occasional failure does not turn a
 *    working capability into a broken one every session.
