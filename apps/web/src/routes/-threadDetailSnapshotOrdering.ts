// FILE: -threadDetailSnapshotOrdering.ts
// Purpose: Ordering rules between thread-detail snapshots, the pre-snapshot event
//          buffer, and the applied per-thread cursor.
// Layer: Web EventRouter helper (pure)
// Why: The event router applies stream events, stream snapshots, and projection
//      reads that race each other. A snapshot must never move the cursor behind
//      events the store already consumed, and events dropped from the bounded
//      pre-snapshot buffer must never leave an unnoticed hole in the transcript.

/**
 * Whether a thread-stream snapshot may replace the cached detail.
 *
 * A snapshot older than the applied cursor would roll the store back and move
 * the cursor behind events that were already consumed, so later deltas would
 * either be lost or re-applied by a catch-up replay. The only legitimate older
 * snapshot is a server-side reset (a fresh database restarts sequences), which
 * is observable only while the cursor is still the cached resume seed and no
 * event has moved it and no snapshot of the current subscription has confirmed it.
