# Attribution

Synara adapts ideas and sometimes code from other open source projects. This file credits the ones that shaped a feature.

What belongs here: code, constants, or prose Synara copied or adapted, and features materially shaped with no code copied.

What does not belong here: ordinary dependencies, even large ones (Effect, Pi). `package.json` and `bun.lock` already record those with their licenses.

Credit is not a license notice. If you copy code or prose, carry the upstream notice with it.

<!-- Style: no em dashes in this file. Use commas or colons. -->
