# Native voice drafts

In a conversation, choose the microphone button to record, choose Stop to
transcribe, or Cancel to discard the recording. While recording, plain Enter
stops the recording too; Chat behavior can choose whether that Enter action
only transcribes into the draft (the default) or sends the unchanged draft
after transcription. The composer explains before recording that the clip is
uploaded to ChatGPT for transcription. Clicking Stop, automatic limit stops,
and the default Enter behavior append a successful transcript to the current
unsent draft for review; they never send it automatically.

Recording requires a selected task, a working microphone and operating-system
microphone permission. Transcription requires a ChatGPT-authenticated Codex
session. Clips stay in memory, are capped at 120 seconds and 10 MiB, and are
encoded as 24 kHz mono WAV. Authentication and upload requests are timed out;
the upload is restricted to the official ChatGPT HTTPS origin without redirects.
Cancel, task navigation and shutdown stop the active operation. If the task or
draft changes before the result arrives, Synara leaves the newer draft
untouched. An accepted transcript is written to the task draft store.

Focused voice regression tests now pass on Linux x64, macOS arm64 and
Windows x64. The macOS development package is validated as a Synara.app bundle
with NSMicrophoneUsageDescription and an executable payload, while the Windows
package is expanded and checked for the expected executable and target manifest.
A live microphone plus ChatGPT upload is still a separate end-to-end acceptance
journey.
