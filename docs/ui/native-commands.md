# Native workflow slash commands

Type `/` or `/synara/` in the composer to see the native command menu. Select a
row or type the exact command and press Send. Native commands are accepted only
at the start of the entire trimmed draft. The bounded argument forms are
`/synara/goal set <objective>`, `/synara/automation list|new|edit <id>` and
`/synara/settings <section>`; unknown names,
unsupported arguments and extra text remain in the draft and are never sent to a
provider.

The qualified namespace avoids collisions: ACP-advertised command names do not
allow an embedded slash. `/plan`, `/debug` and other provider command names remain
provider-owned. Native commands do not change their interpretation.

| Command | Native action |
| --- | --- |
| `/synara/model next` | Select the next live-advertised ACP model, matching the configured composer shortcut. Unavailable, busy, direct-model or loading sessions retain the command. |
| `/synara/model previous` | Select the previous live-advertised ACP model, matching composer Alt+[. No prompt is sent and other task drafts are not changed. |
| `/synara/plan` | Select the connected ACP session's advertised Plan mode through the existing control owner. Unsupported/direct-model sessions retain the command and report the limitation. |
| `/synara/debug` | Open the evidence-first Debug workflow. |
| `/synara/goal` | Open goal review without changing or arming a goal. |
| `/synara/goal set <objective>` | Save this task's objective as paused and open goal review. An active pursuit or unsaved goal edits block replacement. This command does not resume the goal or send a provider prompt; explicit Resume and Send are still required. The objective is limited to 4 KiB. |
| `/synara/recap` | Open recap review without automatically generating a response. |
| `/synara/fork` | Create a new unsent same-checkout branch through the last saved assistant turn. No hidden state, tools or permissions are copied. |
| `/synara/subagents` | Open Workflows settings without starting agents. |
| `/synara/automation` | Open automation review without arming the scheduler. |
| `/synara/automation list` | Open the saved automation list without arming the scheduler. |
| `/synara/automation new` | Open the unsaved automation form with the current project selected when available. Saving is a separate explicit action; this command does not schedule or submit a provider prompt. |
| `/synara/automation edit <id>` | Open the saved automation with the exact UUID shown in its list card for review in the existing editor. A loaded list and no active form or save are required. The command does not save, enable, schedule or run it. |
| `/synara/computer-use` | Open Computer Use settings without selecting, observing or controlling a window. |
| `/synara/status` | Open reported Usage details. Missing provider telemetry remains unknown. |
| `/synara/settings [section]` | Open General settings, or the exact named section. The menu lists all 23 accepted section IDs; unknown names and extra arguments are refused without sending a provider prompt. |
| `/synara/export` | Open the system save dialog for the existing Markdown text export. |
| `/synara/export-zip` | Save a finished conversation as a compressed ZIP containing `thread.json` and `transcript.md`. Both entries share one durable snapshot. |

Settings section IDs: `onboarding`, `device`, `privacy`, `general`, `profile`,
`appearance`, `notifications`, `behavior`, `keybindings`, `usage`, `appsnap`,
`computer`, `plugins`, `mcp`, `providers`, `models`,
`project-import`, `skills`, `worktrees`, `system`, `archived`, `workflows`.

The normal Send entry point applies task, loading, busy, connection, IME, pending
control and draft ownership guards. The Stop button remains Stop. Menu callbacks
recheck the exact task and text before replacing a partial command. Successful
commands consume only their exact command line, not attachments or other drafts.
Native command drafts survive restart as unsent text and never auto-execute.

This is intentionally not full upstream command parity: argument forms beyond
the bounded goal setter, automation list/new/edit and settings-section forms, the unqualified shared
namespace and provider-native forks remain open. Existing linked worktree
selection is available from an assistant message, while managed creation and
cleanup remain open. ZIP export
includes text and recorded image metadata, not image bytes, unsent drafts,
credentials, tool payloads or workspace files. `/synara/computer-use` opens
review, whereas upstream's
`/computer-use <task>` has per-request execution semantics.

Configured model-cycle shortcuts only act while the main composer owns focus. Held keys,
character-preferred/IME input, open menus, side-chat fields, editors and terminals
retain their existing ownership. Extra command arguments are refused.

Assistant-message worktree forks now offer a separate reviewed new-local-worktree
choice alongside existing linked worktrees. This does not change the same-checkout
`/synara/fork` command, provider-native session semantics or automatic cleanup.
